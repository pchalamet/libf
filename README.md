# About
libf is reimplementation of Rust stdlib in F# because, well, it's fun ;-)
See official Rust documentation (https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/).

As of now, it's a really small subset of Rust stdlib. Only few namespaces are supported:
* std.result

std.io and std.fs will be implemented but other way probably.
